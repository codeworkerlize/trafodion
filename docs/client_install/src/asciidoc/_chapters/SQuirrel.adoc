+
Use the file browser to navigate to the directory where you installed the 
drivers and select the driver. (`jdbct4\lib\jdbcT4.jar`)

.. If configured correctly, you will see a message stating 
"Driver class org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4Driver successfully registered for driver definition: Trafodion" in the text box 
at the bottom of the SQuirreL SQL window.
