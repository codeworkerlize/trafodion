= Configure Tableau Client

== Prerequisite Software

Make sure that you have this software installed on your workstation:

* {project-name} Windows ODBC Driver. See <<install-windows-odbc-driver,Install Windows ODBC Driver>>.
* Tableau Software. See the http://www.tableau.com/trial/download-tableau[_Tableau website_].

== Tableau Datasource Configuration (.tdc) File

=== Create .tdc File

The Tableau Datasource Configuration (`.tdc`) file is used to customize and tune ODBC connections.

NOTE: You can download each sample documented herein by clicking the link provided with the
sample name. For example, click on link:{tableau}/trafodion.tdc[trafodion.tdc]
to download a `.tdc` file for Tableau 9.3 using Trafodion ODBC 2.1. +
 +
You can access the complete source directory at: {docs-url}/client_install/resources/tableau/

The `.tdc` file contains version-specific settings that you need to modify. 

.Template: link:resources/tableau/trafodion.tdc.template[`trafodion.tdc.template`]

[source, xml]
----
include::{tableau}/trafodion.tdc.template[Trafodion `.tdc` template file]
----

Save this file as `trafodion.tdc` and change the following placeholders:

* `<tableau-version>` - Change to the version of Tableau you're using. For example: `9.3`
* `<trafodion-driver-name>` - Change to the name of the Trafodion ODBC driver you're using. For example: `TRAF ODBC 2.1`

Once edited, your `trafodion.tdc` file should look similar to the example below.

.Example: link:resources/tableau/trafodion.tdc[`trafodion.tdc`]

[source, xml]
----
include::{tableau}/trafodion.tdc[`trafodion.tdc`]
----

=== Install .tdc File

Copy the `trafodion.tdc` file to the `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Datasources` folder.

Restart Tableay if it's running to pick up the configuration change.
