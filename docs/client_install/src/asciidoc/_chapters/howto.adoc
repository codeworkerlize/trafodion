= How To

[[howto-setup-path]]
== Set Up Path Variable

You need to update your PATH variable for Java and the {project-name} clients.
The examples below show how to add Java to your PATH variable. The process
is similar for the different {project-name} clients.

NOTE: You typically point the PATH variable to the `bin` directory, if it exists.
Otherwise, you point the PATH variable to the directory containing the client executable.
The examples below point to the Java `bin` directory.

[[howto-setup-path-windows]]
=== Set PATH Variable on Windows

==== Windows 10

. Right-click on the Windows icon on the menu bar. Select *System*.
. Click on *Advanced System Settings*.
. In the *System Properties* dialog box, click the *Advanced* tab.
. Click the *Environment Variables* button.
. Under *System* variables, select the variable named *Path*, and then click *Edit. . .*:
+
image:{images}/win10_edit_path.jpg[Windows 10 Edit Path Variable]
+
<<<
. Click *Browse. . .*. Find the directory where you installed Java or the {project-name} client. Select the `bin` directory as applicable.
+
image:{images}/win10_select_java.jpg[image]

.  Click *OK* to close the browse window. Click *OK* to close the edit window.
.  Verify that the updated *Path* appears under *System* variables, and click *OK*.
.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click *OK* to accept the changes.

<<<
==== Windows 8

. Right-click the *Computer* icon on your desktop, and then select *Properties*. The *Control Panel > System and Security > System* window appears.

. In the left navigation bar, click the *Advanced* system settings link.

.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click the *Environment Variables* button.

.  Under *System* variables, select the variable named *Path*, and then click *Edit*:
+
image:{images}/path2.jpg[image]

.  Place the cursor at the start of the *Variable* value field and
enter the path of the Java or {project-name} client `bin` directory, ending with a semicolon (;):
+
image:{images}/varval2.jpg[image]
+
*Example*
+
```
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin";
```
+
NOTE: Check that no space exists after the semicolon (;) in the path. If there are spaces in the directory name, delimit the entire directory path in double quotes (") before the semicolon.

.  Click *OK*.
.  Verify that the updated *Path* appears under *System* variables, and click *OK*.
.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click *OK* to accept the changes.

For a full installation, a sample PATH variable may contain:

```
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_101\;C:\trafodion\trafci\bin\;
```


[[howto-setup-path-linux]]
=== Set PATH Variable on Linux

. Open the user profile (`.profile` or `.bash_profile` for the Bash shell) in the `$HOME` directory.
+
```
cd $HOME
vi .profile
```

. In the user profile, set the `PATH` environment variable to include the path of the Java 
or {project-name} client `bin` directory. 
+
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0/bin
```
+
NOTE: Place the path of the Java bin directory after `$PATH` separated by colon (`:`). 

.  To activate the changes, either log out and log in again or source in the user profile.
+
```
source profile
```

For a full installation, a sample PATH variable may contain:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0/bin:/opt/user/trafodion/trafci/bin
```

[[howto-setup-path-verify]]
=== Verify PATH Variable

Ensure that you can access the Java or {project-name} client
from the command line.

*Examples*

Display the Java version.

```
c:\trafodion> java -version

java version "1.7.0_45" # This is the version you need to check
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode, sharing)
c:\trafodion>
```

Display the trafci version.

```
c:\trafodion> trafci -version

If you cannot display the version information, then you need to 
check your PATH variable settings again.
