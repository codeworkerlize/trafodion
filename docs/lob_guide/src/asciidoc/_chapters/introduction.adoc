[#what is a lOB]
== What is a LOB

LOB (Large Object), a set of large object data types used to store large volumes of data, provides random and piece-wise access to the data. 

Database support for LOB is not universal.

[#lob data types]
== LOB Data Types

The following are the data types supported by Trafodion. +

.Descriptions for BLOB and CLOB
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| *Data Type*         | *Desciprtion*
| BLOB                | Binary Large Object. + 

Holds large blocks of unstructured data in binary format. +

BLOB is ideal for storing and handling unstructured data, such as images, audio, video and other multimedia objects.
| CLOB                | Character Large Object. +

Stores unusually large amounts of string data in character set format. +

CLOB is ideal for storing and processing semi-structured data, such as a large document or string.

[#lob storage]
== LOB Storage

The basic design idea is to allow a database row to have multiple LOB columns and a table to have multiple such rows. The design takes a combination approach of row store and column store. 

When a SQL table with a LOB column is created, there are several dependent objects that are created to hold metadata information on the LOB as well as the data.

The LOB data itself is stored in an HDFS file while the Trafodion table contains a unique LOB handle for each LOB value. The LOB handle provides the identifier that is used to query the LOB metadata tables to find the location of the LOB data files.

The naming conventions for the LOB tables are as follows:

[#lob handle]
== LOB Handle

The LOB handle is used to describe a LOB value. A SQL table that contains a LOB column will contain this handle structure in each row for each LOB value inserted.

The actual LOB data will be stored in unstructured HDFS files as column store whereas the LOB handleâ€”that describes the location, offset information, descriptor information and so on can be thought of as a unique identifier to the lob data, is stored in the database row of the table as a traditional row store. 

The handle can be thought of as a file locator as is more commonly referred to in LOB related terminology. 

[#external structure]
=== External Structure

The following is an example of an external structure that is stored in the row of a SQL table:

LOBH00000002000100047335557604604880171074381106028370118212279894381354363017"TRAFODION"."SCH"

[#lob restrictions]
== LOB Restrictions

* LOB columns cannot appear in FROM clauses as join predicates.
* LOB columns cannot appear in STORE BY, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clauses.
* LOB columns cannot appear in WHERE clauses as predicates other than LIKE (meaning that no comparison is allowed).
* LOB columns cannot appear in SELECT clauses as aggregate function arguments.
* LOB columns cannot appear in SELECT DISTINCT clauses.
* LOB columns cannot be used as primary keys.
* LOB columns cannot be used in CREATE INDEX statements.
* LOB columns cannot be used in statistics update statements.
* The file that contains data to insert from or to extract to needs to be on platform as a Linux or HDFS files.
