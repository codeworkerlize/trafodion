This README describes steps required to create custom workload scripts

1. Change directory to workload scripts folder
        cd $WMS_SCRIPTS_DIR

2. Copy the default template script to a different workload name
        cp default_script_template sample_workload.py

3. Define or Modify your SLA such that you refer to the custom workload script 
   name so the admission and runtime rules defined in the script are in effect.
        Launch EsgynDB Manager via the browser (http://localhost:4205)
