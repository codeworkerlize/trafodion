3. When check and set the error information, it need to get object's metadata. If the object type in metadata is not table, it will return this error.
4. When update the table's properties, it need to get table's flags from "_MD_".objects first. Please make sure all metadata is right.
   Following statement will check the metadata and if it the reuslt is null, it will return the error.

tdm_arkcmp [-e] [-v] [-g {moduleGlobal|moduleLocal[=OSSdir]}]
[-d compiler-attribute-name=compiler-attribute-value]...

-e  Causes Compiler to generate a warning instead of an error.
-v  Verbose mode.
-g moduleGlobal 
Causes Compiler to place module into the global
/usr/tandem/sqlmx/USERMODULES directory.

-g moduleLocal[=OSSdir] 
Causes Compiler to place module into the named
OSS directory. If OSSdir is omitted, Compiler
outputs module to the current directory.

default settings at the command line.

mxCompileUserModule [-e][-v][-g {moduleGlobal|moduleLocal}] 
[-d <Compiler attribute name>=<Compiler attribute value>]...
<application file> [{<module name>[,<module name>]...}]

<application file> is the OSS pathname of a self-contained
application executable file, native user library, or SQLJ
jar or profile ser file.

If no <module name> is specified, mxCompileUserModule
operates on all embedded module definitions of
<application file>. Otherwise, each <module name> is
the fully qualified three-part name of an embedded module
definition in <application file>, and mxCompileUserModule
operates only on the named embedded module definitions.

-e causes Compiler to generate a warning rather than an error
if a table or DEFINE in an SQL statement does not exist
during explicit SQL compilation. If you are using late
name resolution and want to use a table or DEFINE that
does not exist during explicit SQL compilation, include
the -e option. Then at run time, the SQL executor
automatically recompiles the SQL statement from the
statement's source in the SQL module by using the
run-time version of the table. However, to find errors in
your program during explicit SQL compilation, omit the
-e option.

-v causes Compiler to display summary information in addition
to error and warning messages for the compilation.
-d allows you to specify any Compiler control query default
settings at the command line. The command line settings
override any corresponding settings in the DEFAULTS table.

-g moduleGlobal 
Causes Compiler to place compiled module(s) into the global
/usr/tandem/sqlmx/USERMODULES directory. 
-g moduleLocal 
Causes Compiler to place compiled module(s) into the same
OSS directory as the <application file>.
