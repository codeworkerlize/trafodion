-- Functionality: ORDER BY clause on table and view, plus VSBB insert
-- Expected files: EXPECTED010, EXPECTED010.MP
-- Other files: DIFF010.KNOWN - VSBB insert disabled for small tables
-- Table created: t010ta, t010tx, t010t1, t010tmp1, t010uta, t010utx,
--                t010ut1, t010tb
-- View created: t010va, t010uva, t010vb
-- To do: - Add VSBB insert test in the insert-select stmt. (Done.)
--        - Remove DIFF010.KNOWN.NSK file when Unicode is supported on
--          MX tables, while Unicode may never be supported on MP tables
--          (Done 5/19/02)
--        - Enable VSBB insert for small tables
-- Limitations:
-- Revision history:
--     (1/28/02) - Copied from fullstack/TEST010
--     (2/15/02) - Merged with fullstack/TEST010U
--     (2/18/02) - Added VSBB insert verification via statistics SP.
--     (3/01/02) - Comment off Unicode test if running on MP tables.
--     (5/19/02) - Removed DIFF010.KNOWN.NSK as unicode is supported.
--     (6/13/02) - Added DIFF010.KNOWN as VSBB insert disabled for small
--                 tables (<100 rows)

-- Tests ORDER BY clause:  binder and executor.
-- Ordering is done using BTREE implementation.
