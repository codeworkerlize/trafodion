# This is the template file for Trafodion database authentication 
# directory service configuration.
#
# To use authentication in Trafodion, this file must be configured
# as described below and placed in $TRAF_HOME/sql/scripts and be named
# .traf_authentication_config.  You must also enable authentication by
# running the script traf_authentication_setup in $TRAF_HOME/sql/scripts.
#
# NOTE: the format of this configuration file is expected to change in the 
# next release of Trafodion.  Backward compatilibity is not guaranteed.

# If one or more of the LDAPHostName values is a load balancing host, list
# the name(s) here, one name: value pair for each host.
  LoadBalanceHostName: 

# One or more identically configured hosts must be specified here,  
# one name: value pair for each host.
  LDAPHostName:

# Default is port 389, change if using 636 or any other port
  LDAPPort:389

# Must specify one or more unique identifiers, one name: value pair for each
  UniqueIdentifier:

# If the configured LDAP server requires a username and password to 
# to perform name lookup, provide those here.

# Configuration for searching LDAP groups.
# Set SearchGroupBase to enable LDAP groups
#
# Search base for groups
# For example - ou=groups,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org
#
  LDAPSearchGroupBase:

# Used to filter the groups returned during authentication
# Set the parameters for the server to use to search for LDAP groups
# and their members.
#
# The server constructs an LDAP search based on the group object class
# and member attribute, plus the DN of the user.
#
# The search filter that is constructed by the server looks like:
# (&(objectclass=group-objectclass)(group-member-attribute=user_DN))

# Objectclass to identify group entries
# For example - groupOfUniqueNames or groupOfNames
# Default value: groupOfNames
#
  LDAPSearchGroupObjectClass:groupOfNames

# Attribute from group entry for list of members
# For example - uniqueMember or member
# Default value: member
#
  LDAPSearchGroupMemberAttr:member

# Custom filter for searching groups. Overrides the above two setting if set
# For example
# (&(|(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames)(objectClass=posixGroup))(|(uniqueMember={dn})(memberUid={uid})))
# Server substitutes dn {dn} with user dn and {uid} with user name.
#
#  LDAPSearchGroupCustomFilter:

# Attribute from group entry that would be treated as group name
# Default value: cn
#
  LDAPSearchGroupNameAttr:cn
